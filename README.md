# Text Generation Model using TensorFlow

## Overview

This project focuses on building a text generation model using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning library. The provided Python script demonstrates how to create a simple text generation model that generates the next dialogue based on a given input. Explore this script to understand the basic logic of sequence-to-sequence models for text generation and their implementation using TensorFlow.

## Script Components

- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization and sequence creation for input text.
- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of a simple sequence-to-sequence model using LSTM layers.
- **Training the Model:** Code for training the text generation model.
- **Generating Text:** Logic for generating the next dialogue based on the input.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`text_generation_model.py`) in a Python environment.
2. The script will train the model on the provided dataset (you can replace it with your own).
3. After training, input the seed text (e.g., "QUEEN: So, lets end this") to generate the next dialogue.

## Customization

- Replace the dataset with your own text corpus for training a model specific to your domain.
- Experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies.
- Fine-tune the generated text by adjusting the temperature parameter in the script.
